        <br>
       <p>How do I know?  I have been allowed to look inside my soul, be shown its energies and forces, and learn how the soul is directly connected with Heaven and God. God is the Living Light because God is the ultimate definition of all supernatural and natural light that exists. This holliest of all lights can easily be discovered, felt, accessed, and seen through faith because this living light is the essence of one's living soul. Our soul lives by the light and breath of God's own; without it, nothing could or would exist. God is the greatest power of light, and he gives his light to all who yearn for his love to enter their souls when miracles and revelations begin to occur to reassure that the connection is being held strong, allowing access to the higher dimensions. When God and Christ are invited into one's own hearts, spirits, and souls, spiritual transformations begin to occur as all that is of the heavenly light blesses your very own soul. This is when you truly know you are joined with them all from within and above. And once joined, your very living soul begins to reap the greatest, endless spiritual treasures of all. The connections to learn eternal and everlasting secrets of truth, light, faith, love, spirit, and soul that will always be your very own and are guaranteed through Christ to be eternal.
         </p>
      </div>
         <p>Your living soul is the richest of all spiritual and supernatural treasures, waiting patiently for you to discover its secrets, its powers, its truths, and its rewards. Your soul is the very core, the very essence, of your inner being, given for the purpose of everlasting life. You are your own light; you are here because you were given the light of your soul to share the Holy Spirit of God with the world. You are radiant, you are beautiful, you are wonderful, and you are loved. All the heavens have been patiently waiting for you to figure it all out. You don’t need anything else in this world other than God to learn how to soar to where angels reside. Your soul possesses all the answers concerning the celestials that you will ever need to learn about. They will teach you all of their mysteries and lead you to the brightest of all lights, where Heaven resides. Learn to listen to your spirit and soul carefully to be able to satisfy all of their desires and needs. Give your soul all that it wants, and it will reward you abundantly. Nourish your soul well with the bliss of holiness for its secrets to be revealed. The light of the soul hungers to be fueled by all that is holy and true. Trust in all that you are; you are your own living soul before anything else. Your soul is a miracle—the very work of God alone. Look within, and you will see the treasure that you really are; you alone are the most valuable treasure in all the universe. And always remember the first golden rule of the soul: it cannot be questioned or doubted; it can only be accepted through undoubting faith to bless all that is of your own that blesses and gets blessed from the heavens above.
         </p>
         <h2>What I learned about living light of soul and the Living Light of God</h2>
         <p>For those who live in the spirit, life is about learning the conditions of the soul to gain strength. As faith grows, so does awareness of living light, though if faith is not grounded in righteousness, one’s perception can easily be controlled by much that is not. Those who learn about faith learn about light and darkness, and those who do not are blinded by both. Myself, I have become most familiar with the light of the Holy Spirit, which provides unconditionally to all who yearn to connect with their own. I praise the living light of God with every breath I take, because all that contains me is his own. And because of where my faith has taken me, I believe in his living light above all. The Holy Spirit's living light is the most powerful natural and supernatural light, and it shares and shines its love for all who yearn for and desire its affections. Our God, our Savior Christ Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are the sources from which all unconditional love, all eternal light, and all unwaivering faith originate. What one believes to be true about the Living Light of God is truth for oneself when hope does not doubt. His light is an awe-inspiring light that can be seen and felt through faith in all that is his own. His living light is the very essence of the living soul, which is given to all to learn how to recognize and learn from.
            </p>
       <p>Before attempting to recognize and comprehend 
            the light that is oneself, the light of God must first be recognized. Yes, everyone has their own light of the soul to discover. Only through faith 
            can one be taught all that their light consists of. Once one begins to live for God’s holiest of lights, awareness begins and grows for all 
            spiritual truths. It’s all about learning the strength of faith, and once awareness grows, the invisible living light starts to become visible; 
            this is what living in the Holy Spirit reveals. All who have ever welcomed His Holy Light into their hearts and souls become enlightened, because 
            His is the greatest reality of the very essence of life itself and the most powerful bond with a believer's soul.
         </p>
        <p>Learn to listen to your soul to learn to listen to your spirit. Learn to listen to your spirit to learn to listen to your soul. Only then does one 
         learn how conscious is a part of the trio that begins the understanding of one's life force. Learn to listen to your trio to learn to listen to 
         your faith. And once each is fully understood, this is when and where the four spiritual forces that are your gift of life begin to learn, for the 
         truest and fullest reasons, what your purposes for life are. This is where you begin to have connection and communication with all that is in your 
         destiny and how and why your faith connects with the heavens above. Your living light is alive. Your gift of a soul is eternal, and it yearns so 
         desperately for you to learn its truths. Time is of the essence to learn as much as you can. If one learns too late, how many of its blessings can be 
         given and shared? Or if one never learns of the truths of the living soul, what does that mean when one has to leave this world? Please do not 
         jeopardize your spiritual future. There are many lessons for each person to learn while they are living their appointed time in this world. Do not let 
         time pass you by; become a part of your spiritual destiny now, and you will be blessed.
      </p>
      <p>The awareness of the light of the soul has changed my entire life. It has given me an undeniable yearning to find all of the spiritual truths that I 
         can. There is so much more I want to learn to be able to spiritually grow now that I have been given a glimpse. I want my Holy Lord to be pleased with 
         me concerning my will to serve him with all of my strength. The awareness of the soul has changed me into a devoted spiritual man; I search for the 
         truth within all. And because of my awakenings, it has blessed me with much that I am just beginning to understand. It doesn’t matter where I go from 
         here; nothing will deter my devotion. I have surrendered my life and soul to always be one in Christ. His living light has so much that it wants to 
         share that nothing else matters to me anymore. Just to stay connected to this divine love that radiates from Heaven is all that I am living for, and 
         I praise my Lord with the deepest of loves that I pray will eternally grow.
      </p>
         <h3>The supernatural nature of soul is awakened by faith in Christ's love</h3>
      </div>
       <p>Our world received Jesus Christ, God's holy son and light, as a testimony to his mercy, so that all of creation will be held accountable for his incarnation. As Christians, we received our salvation from and for his glory. His light radiates through all that is corporeal and supernatural. Through faith in his ascension, the two are no longer separate; they become one. His light touches all that is in creation, which is continually a blessing, just as his mercy and love always do.
         </p>
         <p>Most are unaware that there are supernatural lights that exist amongst us that are just as real as what we understand to be reality. Once anyone 
            takes spirituality seriously, they soon become observant of this truth. Though be aware and beware, this initial awareness is when most get deceived 
            into believing a grand form of supernatural light that is not of holiness. Question all supernatural light by the truth of Holy Scripture, and one 
            will not be misleading. Of all with which I have become most familiar, the Holy Spirit's influences have the highest priority. This is where my 
            faith reaches, and this is where my faith thrives. My faith defines all of who I have become, and my faith defies limitations for growth.
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes other supernatural lights besides your own may be revealed for many different reasons. When this happens, do not doubt what you are 
            seeing, because if you do, it will instantly dissipate. And it will not come back again until you have learned not to question or doubt the 
            unfathomable and the unimaginable concerning spiritual truths and to learn more about never doubting faith. These supernatural lights can illuminate anywhere at any time, directly from their own visible or invisible source. Until one learns to recognize how faith and light coexist, one will not be able to look into the light and communicate with all of it.
         </p>
         <p>When one is blessed by the Holy Spirit, it gives the gift of discernment for all spirits and supernatural light. At this point in faith, doubt 
            doesn't exist anymore; only overwhelming trust lives for the most awesome truths. Know that every supernatural light has a spirit of its own that 
            can be felt. Once one learns to feel and be aware of spirits, the recognition of different spirits of light occurs. Know that the first intuition 
            that one feels from any light is always correct; this is the Holy Spirit communicating with one’s self. If it is questionable, then it most likely 
            is opposing. If one goes against their intuition, they will most likely end up being deceived. Know that supernatural light exists in all that is 
            of creation, though only through spiritual eyes that do not doubt can it be seen. Know that even all that is dark has a supernatural light that 
            belongs to itself. Light does exist in darkness, though darkness cannot exist in light. Though it is most important to understand that there is 
            supernatural light that consists of a spirit of darkness that is not the light of the Holy Spirit. If a Christian does not question each spirit 
            of light, or if one is not strong enough through the faith of the Holy Spirit, they will be deceived by a brilliant light that is not holy without 
            knowing they are blindly being misled.
         </p>
         <p>Do not overthink this. These are very simple and easy truths to understand. Do not be overly alarmed because your faith and your will are all 
            that your spirit possesses. And your spirit is what attracts or repels different varieties of supernatural light. Whatever values one possesses 
            are connected through spirit with the kind of light that is attracted to one's own. As a Christian, do not ponder or worry about these issues 
            because your faith has given you the strength to prevail. Your spirit is the essence of righteousness, which blesses the light of the soul to 
            illuminate and transform it into one with holiness. Ask the Lord to teach you everything concerning the supernatural and spiritual light that 
            you need to know, and he will.
         </p>
         <p>The living light that lives inside of you is your living soul. This is your gift of life, which is meant for all to learn and get to know. This 
            living light will teach you everything that you need to understand concerning this spiritual world and prepare you for the next place your soul will 
            eventually go. Without a doubt, you are from the heavens above; you are a direct descendant of his most awesome love. Now that you are becoming 
            aware of his simplest of truths, bless them for spiritual growth. The light that you possess blesses all that it touches. And as it blesses, it also 
            gets blessed in return. Your living light will always be joined with the Holy Spirit to bless and be blessed by all.
         </p>
         <p>To bless the light that lives inside one's soul, one must continue with undoubted faith and an honest condition of spirit. These unions raise 
            awareness about their unique and awesome content. To fully understand the definition of self-spirit, one must control every thought and desire 
            that one possesses, which have their own spiritual energy. Whether there is negative or positive energy is what determines the condition of the 
            self-spirit and the light of the Holy Spirit that wants to thrive within. Negative and positive energy cannot grow together. They are always 
            in conflict, thus depriving conscious, spirit, and soul of spiritual growth and awareness of their truths. Once one gets their thoughts in 
            check with holiness, the blessings begin to transform one’s entire being. Then the living light that lives inside one’s self will be revealed 
            and begin to communicate and teach about growth. The light of the self has much that it wants to share. Only through growth can we learn to 
            recognize the mysteries of life; conscious, spirit, and soul must grow together in faith to reach prosperity.
         </p>
         <p>Understand that along the path of spiritual growth, one must learn about weaknesses and strengths. All must face the questionable and opposing to 
            get stronger. All must learn from their mistakes. When this happens, never give up, no matter what. Pray for strength, and with patience, you will 
            be shown the answers to persevere and prevail. After all of the pain that I caused myself, I finally understand that my purpose for life is to learn 
            the truths of the Living Light of God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit to become one with all that is of their own.
         </p>
         <p>"Everlasting Living Light of God, thank you for rescuing my spirit, restoring my soul, and setting my conscious, spirit, and soul free. With tears of love, I surrender my life and my soul to always be yours. I love you so very much, and I pray that I never get separated from you again. I am so very grateful for your affection; you made me strong, and you keep me strong. You are everything to me, and you are all that I am living for. Your light is brighter than the sun. In fact, if every star that exists in all of creation were to join power and light, theirs would be just a spark compared to your own. And when the time comes for me to leave this world, without a doubt, it won't shake me; I won’t tremble, I won’t stumble, and I won’t fall. I will be ready. I will be standing strong on your holy ground, giving praise and glory to you. You are my only reason for living according to your will, and I thank you for the breath of life that you give me. Your love penetrates and consumes my entire being. I stand before you with open arms. You are all that I ever needed to make my life complete, and I shout it out into the heavens and into the stars for all of creation to know that I will always be your humble and beloved. And I pray that your Living Light that lives inside my soul will always remain. I love you, my Holy Father God, my Lord Jesus Christ, and Your Holiest of All Spirits."
