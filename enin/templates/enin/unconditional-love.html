            <br>
            <p>The essence of unconditional love and the everlasting light of one's living soul teach our spirits how to get closer to the heavens of God. One's own unconditional love, along with faith, are the direct spiritual and supernatural lifelines that connect our conscious, spirit, and soul with all that is of the Holy Spirit of God and our beloved Jesus Christ. It reveals glimpses of the light that is from God and teaches us how to avoid and protect against the forces of darkness. We must learn all of these truths in order to spiritually advance through the barriers and distractions that try to keep us from direct communication with all that is in Heaven and with God. Between where we are and the divine, it's not about the distance between us and God; it's about the strength of faith that our own spirit and soul possess that defies the separation of the distances of dimensions, space, and time. And about the truths of Holy Scripture that one stands strong and firm for. Which allows us to stand in his presence, right here, right now, in real time. Allowing for revelations to be given to awaken faith and open one's eyes to each of our own individual spiritual purposes and destinies. All the while experiencing the eternal, spiritual, and supernatural truths of the divine.
              </p>
           </div>
              <p>We only have a limited amount of time in this world to learn the biblical spiritual meanings, purposes, and definitions of the unconditional love of God. We have been given this opportunity in life to learn to get it right and to get as close to God as possible. This world is our training ground, from which we must learn. If we don't get it right now, before it is time for us to leave, trust me, it will be more difficult when we cross over to the other side. This is our first chance to get it right. Within this world that is spiritual and supernatural, consisting of both light and dark energies, forces, and powers, God's is all that matters the most. This is our introduction to all that is eternal and true. I'm not going to waste any time. I'm going to connect with the unconditional love of God right now to get blessed. The unconditional love of God wants us to learn how to recognize the Holy Spirit as one of his own. Once recognized, one automatically learns how to securely connect with all the truths that are closest to his Holy Words. Once the connection occurs, it becomes the beginning of passions and desires to learn what the purpose of eternal and everlasting life is truly about. God knows us better than we know ourselves. The unconditional love of God most definitely reveals every single hidden truth that is of his own that concerns each one of our own lives. Learn from the truths that he reveals and share their blessed qualities with everyone who is in your life, in your heart, and in your soul.
              </p>
              <p>We must learn what the purpose and meaning of this brief life that we are given here in this world are all about. And to learn how to connect our own spirit and soul with God. It's the easiest lesson in life to learn. In fact, it's not a lesson at all. It's your own gift and fact of life to always be in direct communication. Though we know this gift and fact of life, it only works through faith that does not doubt. Let me explain it to you and make it as easy and simple as I can. Your spirit and soul are more real than anything you possess. And if you know this and believe it without question or doubt about how it works, this is the divine miracle and power of the unconditional love of God, which is our very own individual gift of life. Many, like myself, who do not doubt that this is our very own gift of truth, are being led and are being blessed periodically with glimpses of insight from above to be able to figure it all out. For thus is the purpose and the reason for life, and glimpses are given to all who yearn and get to know unconditional love's truths. And for those who become joined with God's love, all of these answers are given to spiritually advance even closer.
              </p>
            <p>There is no other love that exists that could compare to the strengths and wisdom of unconditional love. This most powerful of loves has rules that must be kept and followed in order to reap its rewards and discover its deepest secrets. It only bonds with those it trusts, though it willingly gives and shares with those who are lost and yearn to feel its touch. Unconditional love always forgives, blesses, and touches the brokenhearted to let them know there is hope. All that matters in unconditional love is that we recognize its much greater truths for all that they are, and from there, the bonding begins. Unconditional love always wants to teach us and always wants to share.
            </p>
           <p>I am only just beginning to learn about unconditional love truths; becoming one with them all is one of my greatest desires and quests. And because of this new-found revelation, I have had a new spiritual awakening and am ready to learn everything possible about unconditional love.
              </p>
           <p>If unconditional love is the strongest power that reaches the footstools of Heaven, then let us strive to become one with it all. If unconditional love is the mightiest power that rules over all creation, then let us learn what the definitions of power and love in the heavens and in our souls are all about. Only then can our hearts, spirits, souls, and eyes be opened to the truths that are given to us from above. And if unconditional love is the deepest of all emotions, then let it fill our hearts so that it can change our thoughts to be like its own. If unconditional love teaches our spirits to soar into the everlasting light of God, then learning about love's never-ending truths is the ultimate purpose for eternal life. When it comes to this most cherished of all loves, there is always something new to experience about its wonders and awe. Blessings of unconditional love abound when we learn how to be one with it all. This is the only love that can teach us about the eternal spiritual winds that blow and that created our very souls. This is the only love that could teach us about the light of our souls, which is the very light of God. We must be strong in faith for unconditional love to come inside of us and guide us closer towards revelations of its never-ending truths and eternal light.
              </p>
          <h2>Unconditional love is eternal and everlasting</h2></div>
          <p>If the unconditional love of God can move mountains, then love is capable of anything and everything we can imagine or dream about. If love grows with each passing day, then love will never have an end, and a thousand years from now, the meaning of time will only be about the eternal and everlasting that our living souls have become joined with. And if God is pure and true love, as we know he is, no one could ever possibly imagine the depths of his unconditional love powers. His love blesses all creation to learn of his truths, endless extremes, and endless possibilities. His love is the highest, mightiest, and most powerful of all divine loves.
              </p>
           <p>The unconditional love of God brought all creation into existence, for all to be a part of his own. God has a plan for everyone and everything that we are destined to learn about. And everything has a reason. Just connect your love with his own, and your eternal life will be secure. His is a love that I pray my own continues to learn from and learns to reflect. And if God's love is eternal, as Holy Scripture says it is, then I pray, "Holy Father God, let your holy love always remain within my soul". Our souls are truly made with and from the unconditional love of God. Therefore, God's unconditional love is the very purpose of everything that does exist. and that is why we give him praise, glory, and honor.
           </p>
              <p>And if love can teach us how to live, then let us learn to be transformed into all that it wants. If unconditional love must never feel pain, then let us learn that the definition of tears of joy are the only tears will ever have again. And if unconditional love is the strongest power, as Holy Scripture says that it is, then from its power and its presence we can never escape.
           </p>
            <p>If unconditional love is the very ingredient that did create our very souls, then this love is the greatest power and mystery that is keeping our souls alive. The unconditional love of God yearns for everyone to be consumed by its everlasting light. All love yearns to be taught and fueled by God alone. I have been yearning my entire life to experience this holiest of all loves, and now that I have, I will never be the same again. My entire life has changed. I am now content. I am now strong, and I am now brave. And if love is the essence of our very soul, then our soul is our most important possession in life that we must learn from and about.
           </p>
           <p>Your soul is made of everlasting light and the unconditional love of God, which originates in Heaven and permeates and penetrates out for all to be joined. It is poured out for all to take into their souls for spiritual nourishment. His love is our lifeline and what guides us to get closer. His unconditional love is a direct connection to our souls that allows direct communication from above and within. It is a connection from which all eternal love flows, from within to above and from above to within. It is of a spiritual river that flows without end, from which is all that is holy and true. Love and faith are most important in life, along with a never-ending hope that will never give up. Never stop believing that the unconditional love of God dwells inside your soul and reveals to you all of its mysteries and truths.
           </p>
           <p>If love can move mountains, then I pray that the Holy Spirit will teach my love and soul how to get closer to the heavenly realms. I will never stop striving and hoping to learn all that I can about the unconditional love of God. I have learned it’s not about distance; it’s about strength of faith and trust. This moment and every other moment I get are my deepest moments of love for this one purpose and one cause. This unconditional love, I cannot deny. It consumes all of my faith. It is a part of me that will always remain, and I pray that this love grows forever. This love that is from the heavens is stronger than anything; it never gives up, and it never lets go. And once you do connect with its awe-inspiring power, there is no looking back. It transforms the very soul for all that is its own.
           </p>
           <p>Unconditional love is the most powerful of all powers, though it is also the most delicate of all energies. It is one of the main reasons for life and the purpose of everlasting life. To learn to recognize its presence is to learn how it is very much alive and knows who possesses it. Its spirit exists in holiness and acknowledges others with qualities like its own. Once it is recognized, it desires to share all of its blessings and strengths, creating new ones. Understanding the forces of unconditional love leads to understanding every mystery of the soul, the heavens, and God. Unconditional love intensifies with trusting faith. Ask for the strength that is needed, and it will be given, and the blessings will continuously flow within you from above.
           </p>
           <p>Unconditional love is like a flame of fire. It knows exactly what it wants from everyone, and it lives to share its truths. It can bless or it can burn because its principles cannot be questioned, compromised, or doubted to ever receive their rewards. Those who desire to learn its deepest definitions must be fully committed to them all. Let it give you all that it wants, and its revelations will never cease. Unconditional love wants to teach you all of its hidden eternal truths. This is the kind of relationship that it wants to share with anyone and everyone who desires it. It wants to fill every heart with its truths. You see, all love is not equal to unconditional love's qualities. It is the only love that truly forgives and yearns for all to do the same. It is from this very power, which is made up of many powers, that the living soul was created.
           </p>
           <p>As time moves forward, the strength of unconditional love intensifies and multiplies as it grows. Unconditional love is the most important gift of life to receive and learn about. This love blesses the mind and the heart continually with gifts of hope and prosperity. Unconditional love always forgives and gives second chances. This love never gives up on anyone; it always waits patiently for your requests and always gives tenderly. And with a sincere heart, your faults are never blamed; they are only given answers for you to correct with overwhelming grace. It keeps one protected from all other loves that are not true. It opens the eyes and the heart to accept its strengths and to be able to stand strong enough to prevail over all and to endure. Just ask for its favor and its mysteries humbly, and be prepared for many wonderful changes to begin.
           </p>
           <p>If love grows with each passing day, then love will never have an end, and a thousand years from now, we will forget what the meaning of time is. And if this unconditional love is eternal, as I know that it is, then I pray, "Please, unconditional love, fill my life and all that I am with all that is of your own".
