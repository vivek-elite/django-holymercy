       <p>We are spirit and soul before anything else, learning first and foremost how to connect with the spiritual, which connects with God. We first learn to feel the highest spiritual powers that connect our souls to and from the heavens above. Through faith, it is revealed that everything we understand to be reality has a spiritual and supernatural definition of its own. In the beginning, we couldn't see it, touch it, or feel it, but we knew in our hearts and souls that it existed through faith. We knew that there was something more out there that was waiting to be discovered. We felt its presence and its power. As our faith grew, the fruition of all that exists in the heavens began to be revealed and began to make sense. We learned how to look from the inside out and from the outside in by connecting with the Holy Spirit of God. Which allowed for the mysteries and powers of the spiritual realms, their dimensions, and the heavens to begin to be seen. This is how faith in the Holy Spirit works. I am only beginning to learn, though what has been revealed to me is meant to be shared with you. Take these words with an open mind that does not doubt the unimaginable and unexplainable, and be blessed to reap the rewards.
      </p> 
      </div>
      <p>As we all know, this world contains independent spiritual realms and other dimensions that coexist within its vicinity. Which means that all are accessible through faith. Which means that spiritual realms are spiritual dimensions capable of connecting with other spiritual realms that each possess different and similar spiritual definitions and qualities. These spiritual and supernatural realms may or may not depend on this world and may or may not coexist within its closest proximities. As well as many others that are closest and are separated by boundaries and authorities. Which means that we are all living in the same spiritual and supernatural world here on Earth, mentally and physically, though we are also living in our own individual, separate spiritual realms by faith, which can be defined as spiritual levels. Because all spiritual realms are divided by individual spiritual levels of faith. And each individual spiritual level contains its own spiritual and supernatural qualities. Each has their own authorities to keep order from chaos. Each has its own populations of entities, beings, and authorities, and each has its own histories of evolution from which they derive their own truths.
         </p>
         <p>This little blue world that we live in is not only tangible; it is also spiritual and supernatural. Though that doesn't mean that we are all living in the same spiritual world, because we are all not, we define our own individual spiritual realities by faith. The spiritual realms are all on different levels. And the levels are what define the spiritual realms. And the level of faith in oneself determines the relam, or realms, one is connected with in spirit. We share these realms with others who are of like-minded faith. We each live within our own individual spiritual realities, and there are countless individual and communal spiritual extremes that exist. Everything that exists in the universe contains spiritual and supernatural qualities. And depending on the faith of one's spirit and soul, this defines closeness to God. Heaven and all realms are linked to this world that we live in. It is only a matter of faith to connect with them all. All are connected within the spiritual, which coexists within all that is within reach of the light of God. It's not about distance; it's about the quality and quantity of faith in each individual. This little blue world we temporarily call home was created for many reasons, though one of the most important is for us to learn where it resides within the spiritual realms.
      </p>
      <p>In this world, our daily spiritual condition is determined by our spiritual journey and by what we do with the faith we learn about. For revelation to occur, one must be in search of spiritual truths. And as faith grows, the more spiritual and supernatural facts of life we learn about, until eventually it all begins to make sense. Spiritual realms can be defined only by the faith of the one who experiences them. These revelations are freely given to all to learn from once one's faith elevates to see the hidden truths. The spiritual and supernatural realms contain the entire universe, just as the universe contains the spiritual realms. Therefore, because we each have our own individual faith, we each experience our own spiritual and supernatural experiences and revelations in our own individual ways.
      </p>
      <p>This world that we share shares the same space and time with all the spiritual realms that are closest to it, just like our conscious and body share the same space and time with our own spirit and soul. It's all about continual spiritual learning as faith grows to recognize the truths of how they are joined. If we do nothing for spiritual growth, we cannot spiritually advance to reach the next level of maturity. Spiritual growth is an educational process built on levels, and depending on what level one is at, that is all that determines the next spiritual level one advances to. And then, eventually, when it comes time to leave this world, the level of faith that we have attained is considered as to where within the spiritual realms one is destined to go when our conscious, spirit, and soul are ready to go to a higher level. We know we have to eventually leave, and we all want to get to Heaven, though without learning the truths of Holy Scripture, one can easily get detoured or lost along the way by believing truths that are not of God and not knowing their lack of faith has led them astray. The truth is easily found in communion and communication with the Holy Spirit, and the truth will set you free. And once found, faith, spirit, and soul become joined to allow all that is hidden to be seen. The truth shows us the direction we must follow to find ultimate spiritual prosperity. Truth alone is a power all to itself, and once found, it shares its powers for strength and bonds that continuously form and grow.
      </p>
      <p>We live in a terrestrial world that is also celestial. All that is capable of being seen is only a glimpse of much greater truths that anticipate your union through spirit with their own. The celestial wants to share all of its love and all of its secrets with you. All one has to do to reap their blessings is raise their faith to their own spiritual level. This is our ultimate goal: to prepare ourselves to leave this world. This is where the spiritual realms begin to trust you. Between Earth and Heaven, there are countless spiritual and heavenly realms that exist where many life forms live. These are their homes. Some have been there since the beginning of time as we know it. Some were sent there to reap spiritual blessings. And some went there when their souls left this world. Just know that there is a spiritual hierarchy that lies between Earth and Heaven. And just know that outside of Earth and Heaven, there is also another hierarchy that exists between Earth and hell. And the realms are just as real and tangible as the Earth. They exist beyond our own awareness of their dimensions, though they are nearby. The people that live there are alive, just like us, and consist of mass and matter similar to our own, though with different qualities of supernatural realities. It varies in each realm, though the closer it is to Heaven, the more overwhelmingly awesome it becomes.
       </p>
         <h2>Spiritual realms have different qualities and quantities of both light and darkness</h2>
         <br>
         <br>
      <p>How many heavenly and spiritual realms are there? No one knows, except God. There could be as many as there are stars in the universe. Which I assume that there possibly are. Especially when you take into account that our God is the God of love. Who freely gives to each and everyone who reaches out to Heaven everything we need or want. He spoils all with his love when your own love is felt within his heart. What I do know is that every spiritual realm has its own different extremes in both the powers of light and darkness. In Heaven, there is no darkness; there is only light. And the light of God reigns supreme in Heaven, within all heavenly realms, and within all that exists in creation. Why? Because God is a spiritual and supernatural light. Who has authority and power over all that exists in light and darkness. And the closer the realms are to Heaven, the more light there is. And the closer the realms are to hell, the more darkness there is. And between Heaven and hell is where all spiritual and heavenly realms exist, including this world, our current home.
         </p>
        <p>Each and every realm is completely different. Each has its own spirits, powers, and authorities. It's about having faith to distinguish truth from lies. The spiritual realms connected to this world are separated by spirits, forces, powers, and authorities for dominance and control. Within each, they are divided, and each side is united in their division. All that exists in darkness avoids the light, and all that exists in light avoids the darkness. And each is ruled by different laws of natural and supernatural truth. There are two kinds of followers: those who believe that God is the living light, the ultimate authority, who has complete control over their lives, and those who refuse to believe the truth. And then there are those who do not know the definitions of spiritual light or spiritual darkness who are lost and are fooled. Acknowledging that one is spiritual means having to choose between being loyal to the light or the darkness. And because we are of this world, we are blessed to be able to distinguish the differences, with assistance from higher heavenly powers for strength to endure, and to learn how to connect to divine spiritual realms, thus bringing us closer to both Heaven and God.

         <h3>Routes, doors, and portals to enter or exit the spiritual realms</h3>
         <br>
         <br>
      </div>
         <p>As there are routes to take in this world to get to various locations, there are also routes to take into all spiritual and heavenly realms. These are routes, doors, or portals that connect each and every realm. To learn how they function, one must learn that they are all connected by the strength of faith. And by the power of the Holy Spirit that one's spirit and soul connect with. The two work together to make it possible. And the keys that open the passageways to enter or exit within come from the spiritual strengths that come from the depth of knowledge of the divine Holy Scriptures of God. For those who do not doubt one single word of Holy Scripture, they are given the spiritual keys to experience revelations and learn all the spiritual and supernatural truths that the Holy Spirit chooses to share. If you feel the Holy Spirit, like I know you do, know that you are being called to be drawn nearer. Faith, love, hope, and truth are four of the strongest energies, forces, and powers to pray for and learn about. Which are also the keys to gaining entrance to or exiting the spiritual and heavenly realms. Once you begin to learn what these energies want, they begin to reveal the secrets to gaining entrance to and from the spiritual and heavenly realms. Knowledge of the spirit, soul, and light of self will be revealed once one learns of the light of God. It happens as faith grows. It's only a matter of devotion and time before all is revealed. In its most basic form, through the mystery of faith, this is how easily divine intervention and prayers work; we are directly connected to Heaven and God through our unwavering love. When faith is involved, the spirit of self is capable of unimaginable possibilities.
